##**Why support us?**

**AWESOM-O** started as a hobby project by **Mattheous and Dragon1320**. We initially used the base code from previous bots that Mattheous made in the past but ended up completely recreating the entire backend. 

It started off small, allowing server specific things like role assignment but escalated extremely quickly as the user requests and our programming knowledge increased. What once was a small server hosted between our computers at alternative times, then turned into a free-tier AWS server and now has turned into a Google Cloud server with enhanced specs and an online dashboard with leaderboards and statistics.


As much as we hate asking for money, it unfortunately has gotten to the point where we cannot simply afford to host the servers without your help. **So if you have found AWESOM-O helpful and enjoy using the features on the server, then consider donating so we can make AWESOM-O great again&trade;!**


##**FAQ:**
####**Where does the money go?**
All of the money is put into the Feinwaru Software shared account which is used for domain payments, server payments etc. To put it simply, it doesn't go towards us as we are currently just earning the bare minimum to keep the servers going, however that isn't great for our future plans, and that's why we need your help.


####**Who/what is Feinwaru Software?**
Feinwaru Software is the company started by Mattheous and Dragon1320. The name is simply the way of pronouncing the Irish word "**féinmharú**", which you can google the meaning of in your own time. We currently have 4 people on our team who are developing different parts of the bot.


**Dragon1320:** Head backend developer and API development.

**Mattheous:** Website and graphic design.

**TowelRoyale:** Backend and South Park style graphics.

**umustalldie2:** Phone Destroyer related commands and features.


####**What future features can we expect?**
A way more complex website/dashboard where you can build your own commands, share your commands and browse other user created commands by other AWESOM-O users.


And a bunch more stuff that I would type but ehhhhhh...
