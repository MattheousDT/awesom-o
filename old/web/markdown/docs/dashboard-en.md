After logging in, one of two things will happen. If you aren’t
in a server containing AWESOM-O, you will receive an alert and will be booted back to the homepage. If
you
are in a server that contains AWESOM-O, you’ll find yourself on the dashboard! From here, you can do
many things, such as…

# Learning the Dashboard

## Sidebar

##### Dashboard Home

Brings you back to the Dashboard Homepage.

This let's you view your own Profile. You can view your stats and change whatever you'd like. 
The changes can also be viewed through the accompanying `-pf` command.

[View the Profiles documentation](/docs/profiles)

##### Scripts

###### Commands

This lets you view all of the commands enabled on the server currently selected.

[View the full list of AWESOM-O's base commands](/docs/commands)

###### Marketplace

The marketplace lets you share commands you have made with our script editors with our community for use on other servers.

[View the Marketplace documentation](/docs/marketplace)

###### Basic Script Editor

This is an easy alternative to create commands quick and easily without having to type JavaScript in manually. 
You can currently choose from 4 presets `(Text, Random Text, Image, and GIFs)`, fill in the relevant information and let AWESOM-O do all the work.

[View the Basic Script Editor documentation](/docs/basic-script-editor)

###### Advanced Script Editor

Contrary to the prior, this lets you dive heads first into the code and create whatever you want. 

**You will need to have an understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript) AND [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to be able to properly use this feature!**

*If you do not have this knowledge, it is advised to stay clear and use the [Basic Script Editor](/docs/basic-script-editor).*

This lets you view the leaderboards from the previous versions of AWESOM-O

## Selectors

Starting from left to right, we have:

##### Server Selector

This lets you select a server to make changes to. **This is an essential component of using the AWESOM-O Dashboard.**

Some pages will require this information be correct in order to function as intended. These are:
1. Marketplace
1. Commands

##### User Details

This will be your Discord Avatar. Once clicked, you can either:

1. View your profile
2. Logout of AWESOM-O

##### Language Selector

This is represented by <i class="far fa-globe"></i>`EN`.

This allows you to change the language from English into any other language that the community has translated AWESOM-O into.
